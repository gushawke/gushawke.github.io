                    <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I have found JavaScript very challenging and have been stumped on simple problems more often
                        than
                        not! I guess learning a new language can be like this at first, however if I was to compare my
                        knowledge to 2 weeks ago I have learnt a lot and certainly am familiar with functions, objects
                        and variables now. When I was blocked in sprint 4 on the FizzBuzz challenge, I was in the weeds
                        for hours. This was not a nice feeling especially with time pressures. I found that taking some
                        time away from the computer helped with this feeling, and gave me a clearer head when I was
                        filtering through material to find the solution.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I wouldn’t say I have the confidence yet to solve anything in an elegant way! However there were
                        moments where I shouted “Yes!!” particularly within the Gradebook segment. This was a tough
                        challenge for me and I spent a lot of time researching how to find the average of an array. This
                        was much easier said than done, and I did need to use the solution as a guide in the end.
                        However I found a similar problem on the Udemy online course which I started before Dev Academy
                        and this helped my learning. After I had solved this my confidence was boosted and it felt good
                        not going to lie! This reflection exercise certainly helped my learning and proved practice is
                        everything!!
                    </p>

                    <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
                    <p>
                        This technique of writing out the problem in plain english like a baking recipe again can be
                        easier said than done. The instructions on the handbook helped, however when it came time for me
                        to write things down I was clueless at times where to start. This will come easier with time and
                        a useful tool to implement.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Trying something</h4>
                    <p>
                        Trial and error - I performed a lot of this. However at times I was way off and can be a fast
                        way to get frustrated. This should be left for when you have done some research on the problem
                        and when you’re confident on a particular challenge.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Rubber ducky method</h4>
                    <p>
                        Talking to a rubber duck instead of interrupting someone else would be my preference. I don’t
                        like asking for help and sometimes feel bad even asking Jo$eph for some guidance…
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Reading error messages</h4>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes these were helpful for when there is an unnecessary symbol or undefined variable etc.
                        I got a lot of error messages….
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Console.logging</h4>
                    <p>
                        This wasn’t really a technique I used on Repl.it however useful for breaking down problems.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Googling</h4>
                    <p>
                        Google and MDN are very useful resources for guidance.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Asking your peers for help</h4>
                    <p>
                        As I am not sure who anyone is - I have not yet asked peers.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Asking coaches for help</h4>
                    <p>
                        Jo$eph has been a great help! Thanks bro
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Improving your process with reflection</h4>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned above, reflecting on functions with the Udemy online course helped deepen my
                        understanding. Also reflecting at the end of the day helps cement learnings.
