                    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
                </div>
                <div>

                    <p>
                        Understanding neuroplasticity can improve your performance of the brain,
                        should you decide to implement neuroplasticity principles. Following these principles can lead to
                        optimum results, which can give people the motivation to keep repeating a new task that doesn’t come
                        natural to them.

                        I will aim to engage these principles when I generally would like to improve at something in
                        particular. One of the principles is Salience, which suggests that the training experience must be
                        meaningful to the person in order to cause change (plasticity). Once I have given myself the
                        commitment to improve at something, these principles will guide me on my journey to improvement.

                    </p>

                    <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        Ways that can increase your neuroplasticity are picking up a new instrument, testing your memory,
                        exercising to give the much needed blood flow to provide oxygen to the neurons, visualising the
                        experience, paying attention, meditation to focus the mind, and arguably the most effective -
                        repetition.

                    <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        Discuss what it is and why it is relevant
                        A growth mindset is relevant if YOU want to remain relevant. Otherwise embracing the same old habits
                        and routines our mind and neurological pathways become weaker as we age.
                        In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
                        I inadvertently realised that I have always embraced change throughout my life and thrive when I am
                        experiencing new things or getting better at new things. What was a surprise was I didn’t realise
                        that what made me feel good would have been the growth mindset I was embracing, rather I thought it
                        was the physical exercise itself which made me feel alive. I now believe that it would be the growth
                        I was experiencing that made me feel alive.

                    <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        Embracing the harder tasks will help me grow on my Dev Academy journey. Just because something
                        doesn’t come naturally to me at first (does coding come natural to anyone at first?) I know that
                        repetition and focus will in deed help me grow and form those neuro pathways I desire.

                        When I come across brick walls in my learning, I will embrace the 10-principles of neuroplasticity
                        to help break down these walls and progress, instead of finding excuses or disengage entirely.
                        Knowing that I will benefit from the learning, to enable me to achieve my career goals will be my
                        motivation.
