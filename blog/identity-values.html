                    <span id="bold">Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</span>

                    <br>
                    <br>I would like to think that I am an ethical consumer, or at least try to be.
                    I believe we all need to make small changes to our lifestyles and diet to help reduce the impact we
                    humans are having on this planet, and preserve this delicate place for generations after us.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I am faced with moral challenges daily, as our system is built on cheap imports such as plastics
                    that end up in our oceans. Our supermarkets are full of plastics which will take thousands of years
                    to decompose. And a lot of the time we don't have a choice.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span id="bold">Kaitiakitanga</span> 
                    <br>is a value which resonates with me and the the whakatauki
                    above. This is roughly translated into stewardship
                    for people, environment, knowledge and culture.
                    <br> 
                    <br> 
                    <span id="bold">Manaakitanga</span> 
                    <br>pay respect to each other.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span id="bold">Rangatiratanga</span> 
                    <br>maintain a high degree of personal integrity and ethical
                    behaviour in all actions and decisions we undertake.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I believe my cultural identity has shaped this belief, and has resulted in change in the way I now
                    consume. For most of my life I didn’t realise the impact I was personally having on the environment
                    around me, and simple everyday choices can go a long way in fighting climate change, by increasing
                    demand for more sustainable options. I.e. locally made goods reduce the demand for international
                    shipping and mass production. Choosing vegetarian food increases demand for plant based alternatives
                    (and they are getting pretty good!).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span id="bold">Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</span>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My strengths in terms of learning are linked to curiosity. When I am truly interested in a topic I
                    generally gain a deep understanding, which usually involves research and books. My weaknesses would
                    be when I am not interested in a topic, I find the learning punishing. (I don’t anticipate Dev
                    Academy being at all punishing as although CSS is rather dry, I know it’s just a part of the process
                    of getting from A to B). In terms of career pathway, my interests should guide me toward what sparks
                    my curiosity, and I’ve been in a career up until now where I stopped learning - more just learning
                    from experience over time. Hence learning something which I am curious or passionate about should
                    lead lay down a solid foundation for my career.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A time where I have encountered resistance or tension whilst trying to work productively within a
                    team recently was when Auckland went into lockdown and we were working remotely. Our team lost it’s
                    glue early on, and impacted productivity and ultimately motivation. (There were some other issues
                    however let’s not go there!).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Strategies I would use to keep on task and productive, were improving my workspace at home. This
                    allowed me to treat my workspace like an office, opposed to the couch or
                    bedroom. This also gave me a routine each morning to “go to work”. Although we would have a meeting
                    each morning and catch up, people were disengaged and I was disengaged. We wouldn’t get the same
                    small chat interactions as you would in the office.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Another strategy I would do is cal my collegues
                    up for non-work related catch ups. This helped my engagement and improved my work. If I was to work
                    remotely again I would try implementing more initiatives to boost morale and engagement, such as
                    some kind of online game or social catch up.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I believe remote working on top of lockdown is very
                    challenging on many aspects including relationships and mental health. Especially if I am in a
                    leadership position, I would not make targets the focus, rather focus on comaradary, which I believe
                    would improve targets ultimately.
