                    <h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego as a result of the core
                        learning? </h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>

                        1 - I have learnt my attention span could be much better than what it is.
                        I don’t know if this has always been as bad as what it is, or since the lockdowns I might have
                        grown dependant on my phone and my brain is craving stimuli almost every 2 minutes.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        2 - My ego took a hit multiple times. For instance being stuck on basic
                        javascript and other class members were well ahead of me. Or thinking I was creative then
                        looking at some amazing blog designs from classmates.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        3 - That human skills are more valuable than programming skills.

                    <h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I believe the role of these in programming are vitally important for when you are working with
                        other people. Knowing what environment you work best in, and what your needs are from your team,
                        can establish a functional environment. Self awareness can also unlock potential. For instance
                        if you are inclined to be opinionated, opening your mind to other perspectives can enable
                        growth. In programming, growth is a constant. Life-long learning is a key to personal growth,
                        and knowing what your limitations are through values, empathy (or lack of) and self awareness
                        can be the key to a successful career.

                    <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <P>
                        Certainly learning about Neuroplasticity. You are never too old to start new neuropathic links
                        within your brain. Even the power of visualisation can create and improve these links.
                    </P>

                    <br>
                    <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
                    <br>
                    <P>
                        Diving deep into who you are. I haven’t really done values etc since school days! And a lot has
                        changed since then. I found myself naturally thinking about the values which I had once upon a
                        time, and then after more thought, I would alter these to reflect who I am now.

                    </P>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Why do you think that we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                        learning in a web development bootcamp course?  </h3>
                    <br>
                    <P>
                        Because this is what employers look for and will make this course look good if we all get
                        employed
                        after this course…. AND these skills are what set you up for a successful career as they are
                        needed for working within teams day-to-day. :)

                    </P>

                    <br>

                    <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have
                        just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
                    <br>
                    <P>
                        No. I found this super useful and a great reminder that being human is just as important as
                        being able to program on a computer. Not only this, but it actually enables you to be a better
                        programmer. I found the Core section on Neuroplasticity super insightful as I was also
                        struggling with Javascript. This helped me to keep grinding even though I was sucking big time
                        at the challenges.
