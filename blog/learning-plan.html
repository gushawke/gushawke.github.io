                    <span id="bold">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</span>

                    <br> Wow, what a big question… My long-term career pathway is definitely entrepreneurship within the
                    tech industry. In terms of a goal I guess it would be developing a valid idea and building a
                    sustainable business model for the idea.

                    <span id="bold">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</span>
                    <br>
                    If I am curious about a particular topic I would spend time gaining a deep understanding
                    effortlessly.
                    I can get sidetracked easily and stuck down rabbit holes very easily so I’m often reminding myself
                    to remain on track!
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <span id="bold">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</span>

                    Asking the right questions. I am probably more confident than most when it comes to speaking in
                    front of people, or socialising. However, asking the right questions or difficult questions is
                    something I strive to improve on.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    <span id="bold">A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</span>
                    <br>
                    I will treat this course like a full-time job and take responsibility for my own outcomes. I So far
                    in this course I have found Toggl and timeboxes very handy. This will keep me on track and hopefully
                    improve my productivity. I have however found myself in the weeds and just going for a walk/run
                    outside has instantly improved my headspace. So some sort of exercise or meditation will be key to
                    my productivity and ultimately my contribution to the team. I do want to jump at opportunities to
                    develop, though given the short time-frame we have here at Dev Academy I will prioritise learning
                    over socializing… though both have its place!
                    <br>

                    <br>
                    <span id="bold">A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</span>
                    <br>
                    I will firstly attempt to seek answers on google.
                    Trial and error - write down the problem in plain english and then try and resolve this on my own.
                    If not prevail I will scroll through Slack to see if the same question has been asked and if not
                    pick up the courage to ask the class!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <span id="bold">A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</span>
                    <br>
                    I really like the Dev Academy’s flipped classroom learning style and ‘just in time’ learning
                    strategy. So I expect guidance as opposed to silver spoon answers.
